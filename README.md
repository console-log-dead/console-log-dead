# console.log("im dead.")
_Just a student from singapore uh i use this for assignments and stuff_

Currently struggling with learning how to back end web dev with Node.JS and the like. I do Python on the side too.
I haven't got a clue why my college makes us learn web dev stuff though (I'm in an AI & analytics course)
